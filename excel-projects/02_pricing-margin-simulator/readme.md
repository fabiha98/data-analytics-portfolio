# 💰 Pricing & Margin Simulator (Excel)

## 🧩 Business Problem
Pricing teams need to understand how changes in product pricing
impact revenue, profit, and margins. Incorrect pricing decisions
can either hurt profitability or reduce sales volume.

This model helps simulate pricing scenarios to support
data-driven pricing decisions.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The model uses product-level data including:
- Base selling price
- Expected sales volume
- Variable cost per unit
- Fixed costs

Multiple products are analyzed to compare margin sensitivity
across the portfolio.

---

## 🛠️ Model Structure
The Excel model is divided into clear analytical layers:
- **Raw_Data:** Base prices and volumes
- **Cost_Structure:** Variable and fixed costs
- **Pricing_Model:** Revenue, profit, and margin calculations
- **Scenario_Analysis:** Pricing strategy simulations
- **Insights:** Business conclusions

---

## 🧮 Excel Techniques Used
- `XLOOKUP` for cost mapping
- Revenue and profit formulas
- Margin % calculations
- Scenario analysis (Discount / Base / Premium)
- Structured, modular Excel design

---

## 📈 Pricing Scenarios Analyzed
- **Discount Pricing:** Lower price with higher volume
- **Base Pricing:** Current pricing strategy
- **Premium Pricing:** Higher price with reduced volume

Each scenario evaluates trade-offs between growth and profitability.

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- High-volume products are more sensitive to price changes
- Discounting increases sales volume but reduces margins
- Premium pricing improves margins but risks demand drop
- Different products require different pricing strategies

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Avoid blanket discounting across all products
- Apply premium pricing selectively to high-margin products
- Use scenario-based analysis before finalizing pricing decisions
- Continuously monitor volume response to price changes

---

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates a practical Excel-based pricing model
that supports strategic decision-making by balancing growth and
profitability.
