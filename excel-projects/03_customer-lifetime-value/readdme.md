# 👤 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Model – Excel

## 🧩 Business Problem
Businesses need to understand how much profit a customer
generates over their lifetime in order to:
- Optimize marketing spend
- Improve retention strategies
- Focus on high-value customers

This model calculates Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using
financial and behavioral metrics.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level metrics including:
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Purchase Frequency
- Retention Rate
- Customer Acquisition Cost

These inputs are commonly available in CRM and sales systems.

---

## 🛠️ Model Structure
The Excel model is organized into the following layers:
- **Raw_Customer_Data:** Customer behavioral inputs
- **CLV_Metrics:** Discount rate and time horizon
- **CLV_Model:** CLV calculations
- **Segmentation:** Customer value classification
- **Insights:** Business conclusions

---

## 🧮 CLV Calculation Logic
CLV is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach:

- Annual Revenue = AOV × Purchase Frequency
- Gross CLV = Discounted lifetime revenue
- Net CLV = Gross CLV − Acquisition Cost

This approach reflects the time value of money and retention risk.

---

## 🔍 Customer Segmentation
Customers are segmented based on Net CLV:
- **High Value**
- **Medium Value**
- **Low Value**

This enables targeted marketing and retention strategies.

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Retention rate has a significant impact on customer lifetime value
- High-value customers contribute disproportionately to profits
- Acquisition costs must be evaluated against long-term value
- Low CLV customers require cost-efficient engagement

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Invest more in retaining high CLV customers
- Reduce acquisition spend for low-value segments
- Design loyalty programs to improve retention
- Use CLV to guide marketing budget allocation

---

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates a practical Excel-based CLV model
that supports strategic customer and marketing decisions.
