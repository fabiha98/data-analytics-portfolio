## Customer Segmentation Analysis Dashboard

---

### Business Problem
The goal of this analysis was to understand customer purchasing behavior and demographic distributions to optimize marketing spend. The business needed to identify which gender segments contribute most to total revenue, which product categories are "popular" versus "high-value," and how payment preferences vary across the customer base.

### Dataset Explanation

The dashboard processes retail transaction data focusing on customer demographics and product performance. Key data points include:
* **Demographics:** Gender (Male/Female) and Age groups.
* **Product Metrics:** Categories (Clothing, Cosmetics, Technology, etc.), price points, and quantities sold.
* **Transactions:** Total spending and preferred payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card).

### Key KPIs
* **Total Spending:** 161.77M
* **Top Category by Volume:** Clothing (34K units sold)
* **Primary Revenue Driver:** Female Customers
* **Most Popular Payment Method:** Cash

### Insights
* **Gender Revenue Gap:** Female customers significantly outspend male customers, contributing a substantially higher portion of the total revenue.
* **Category Performance:** While **Clothing** is the most popular product by volume (34K), the **Technology** category commands the highest average price despite lower sales quantities.
* **Spending Peaks by Age:** Revenue trends fluctuate significantly with age, showing major spending spikes around the ages of **30** and **60**, with a notable dip in the mid-40s.
* **Payment Preferences:** **Cash** is the dominant payment method, followed by Credit Cards, with Debit Cards being the least utilized.
* **Purchase Volume:** The **Purchase Count by Gender** chart confirms that Female customers lead in volume across nearly every category, particularly in Clothing and Cosmetics.

### Business Recommendations
* **Targeted Marketing:** Allocate a larger portion of the advertising budget toward female-centric campaigns, specifically focusing on the **Clothing** and **Cosmetics** categories where engagement is highest.
* **Premium Tech Strategy:** Since **Technology** has a high price point but lower quantity, implement "Tech Bundles" or loyalty rewards to increase the unit volume for high-value items.
* **Age-Specific Promotions:** Launch "Milestone" marketing campaigns targeting the high-spending 30-year-old and 60-year-old cohorts to capitalize on existing spending peaks.
* **Payment Incentives:** To reduce the reliance on cash handling, introduce small discounts or cashback incentives for customers using **Credit** or **Debit cards**.
